        <li><h3>Explain how plan driven and agile development can be balanced for the development.</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="../../graphics/planbaseddev.jpg" alt="plan based development" width="350">
            <br><br>Plan-driven development <br> A plan-driven approach to software engineering is based around separate development stages
            with the outputs to be produced at each of these stages planned in advance. <br> Not necessarily
            waterfall model: plan-driven, incremental development is possible. <br> Iteration occurs within
            activities.
            <br><br>
            <img src="../../graphics/agiledev.jpg" alt="agile development" width="350"><br>
            Agile development <br>
            Specification, design, implementation and testing are inter-leaved and the outputs from the
            development process are decided through a process of negotiation during the software
            development process. <br>
            Most projects include elements of plan-driven and agile processes. <br> Deciding on the balance
            depends on many technical, human, and organizational issues. <br>
            Technical, human, organizational issues <br><br>
            Most projects include elements of plan-driven and agile processes. Deciding on the balance
            depends on: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Is it important to have a very detailed specification and design before moving to
                    implementation? <br>&#8658;If so, you probably need to use a plan-driven approach.</li>
                <li>Is an incremental delivery strategy, where you deliver the software to customers and get rapid
                    feedback from them, realistic? <br>&#8658;If so, consider using agile methods.</li>
                <li>How large is the system that is being developed? <br>&#8658;Agile methods are most effective when the system can be developed with a small co-
                    located team who can communicate informally. <br> This may not be possible for large
                    systems that require larger development teams so a plan-driven approach may have to be
                    used.</li>
                <li>What type of system is being developed?<br>&#8658;Plan-driven approaches may be required for systems that require a lot of analysis before
                    implementation (e.g., real-time system with complex timing requirements).</li>
                <li>What is the expected system lifetime?<br>&#8658;Long-lifetime systems may require more design documentation to communicate the
                    original intentions of the system developers to the support team.</li>
                <li>What technologies are available to support system development?<br>&#8658;Agile methods rely on good tools to keep track of an evolving design</li>
                <li>How is the development team organized?<br>&#8658;If the development team is distributed or if part of the development is being outsourced,
                    then you may need to develop design documents to communicate across the development
                    teams.</li>
                <li>Are there cultural or organizational issues that may affect the system development?<br>&#8658;Traditional engineering organizations have a culture of plan-based development, as this is
                    the norm in engineering.</li>
                <li>How good are the designers and programmers in the development team?<br>&#8658;It is sometimes argued that agile methods require higher skill levels than plan-based
                    approaches in which programmers simply translate a detailed design into code</li>
                <li>Is the system subject to external regulation?<br>&#8658;If a system has to be approved by an external regulator (e.g., the FAA approve software
                    that is critical to the operation of an aircraft) <br> then you will probably be required to
                    produce detailed documentation as part of the system safety case.</li>
            </ul>
        </p></li><br><br>




        <li><h3>Describe the SCRUM process</h3>
        <p>
            -The Agile mode was primarily designed to help a project to adapt to change requests quickly.
            <br>-Main aim of the agile mode is to facilitate quick project completion.
            <br>-SCRUM Is a type of agile framework.It is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problem while productivity and creativity of delivering product is at highest possible values. <br>
            -SCRUM Uses iterative process. <br>
            <img src="../../graphics/sprintcycle.jpg" alt="sprint cycle" width="350">
            <br>-There are three phases of SCRUM:
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li>The initial phase is an outline planning phase where you establish the general objectives for
                    the project and design the software architecture.</li>
                <li>This is followed by a series of sprint cycles, where each cycle develops an increment of the
                        system.</li>
                <li>The project closure phase wraps up the project, completes required documentation such as
                            system help frames and user manuals and assesses the lessons learned from the project.</li>
            </ol>
            The innovative feature of Scrum is its central phase namely the sprint cycles. <br> A Scrum
            sprint is a planning unit in which work to be done is assessed, <br> features are selected for
            development and the software is implemented. <br> At the end of a sprint the completed
            functionality is delivered to the stakeholders. <br>
            Key characteristics of this process are as follows: <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Sprints are fixed length, normally 2-4 weeks. They correspond to the development of a release
                    of the system in XP.</li>
                <li>The starting point for planning is the product backlog, which is the list of work to be done on
                    the project</li>
                <li>The selection phase involves all of the project team who work with the customer (product
                    owner) to select the features and functionality to be developed during the sprint. </li>
                <li>Once these are agreed, the team organize themselves to develop the software. During this
                    stage the team is relatively isolated from the product owner and the organization, with all
                    communications channeled through the ScrumMaster. The role of the ScrumMaster is to
                    protect the development team from external distractions.</li>
                <li>At the end of the sprint the work done is reviewed and presented to stakeholders (including
                    the product owner). Velocity is calculated during the sprint review; it provides an estimate of
                    how much product backlog the team can cover in a single sprint. Understanding the team's
                    velocity helps them estimate what can be covered in a sprint and provides a basis for measuring
                    and improving performance. The next sprint cycle then begins.</li>
            </ol>
            <img src="../../graphics/Scrum.jpg" alt="scrum process" width="350">
            The ScrumMaster is a facilitator who arranges short daily meetings (daily scrums), tracks the
            backlog of work to be done, <br> records decisions, measures progress against the backlog and
            communicates with the product owner and management outside of the team. <br> The whole team attends daily scrums where all team members share information, <br> 
            describe their progress since the
            last meeting, problems that have arisen and what is planned for the following day.

        <li><h3>Write a short note on Extreme programming</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="../../graphics/extremeprogramming.jpg" alt="extremeprogramming" width="350"><br><br>
             <u>Extreme Programming</u><br><br>
            The name of the approach is coined due to iterative development at the extreme levels. In
            extreme programming requirements are expressed as scenarios (called user stories) which are
            implemented directly as a series of tasks. <br>
            Programmers work in pair and develop tests for each
            task before writing the code. All tests must be successfully executed when new code is integrated
            into the system. There is short time gap between releases of the system. <br>
            Extreme programming involves a number of practices as follows :
            <br><table>

            </table><br>
            <u>Extreme Programming approach</u> <br>
            First, start off by describing the desired results of the project by having customers define a set of
            stories. As these stories are being created, the team estimates the size of each story. This size
            estimate, along with relative benefit as estimated by the customer can provide an indication of
            relative value which the customer can use to determine priority of the stories. <br><br>

            If the team identifies some stories that they are unable to estimate because they don’t understand
            all of the technical considerations involved, they can introduce a spike to do some focused
            research on that particular story or a common aspect of multiple stories. <br><br>

            Spikes are short, time-boxed time frames set aside for the purposes of doing research on a
            particular aspect of the project. Spikes can occur before regular iterations start or alongside
            ongoing iterations. <br><br>

            Next, the entire team gets together to create a release plan that everyone feels is reasonable. This
            release plan is a first pass at what stories will be delivered in a particular quarter, or release. The
            stories delivered should be based on what value they provide and considerations about how
            various stories support each other. <br><br>

            Then the team launches into a series of weekly cycles. At the beginning of each weekly cycle,
            the team (including the customer) gets together to decide which stories will be realized during
            that week. The team then breaks those stories into tasks to be completed within that week.
            At the end of the week, the team and customer review progress to date and the customer can
            decide whether the project should continue, or if sufficient value has been delivered.
