                    <li>The complex relationships between the components in a system mean that a system
                        is more than simply the sum of its parts. It has properties that are properties of the
                        system as a whole. These ‘emergent properties’ cannot be attributed to any specific part of
                        the system. Rather, they only emerge once the system components have been integrated. <br>
                        Some of these properties, such as weight, can be derived directly from the comparable properties
                        of subsystems. More often, however, they result from complex subsystem interrelationships.</li><br>

                        <ol>
                            <li>functional ESP - <br>when the purpose of a system only emerges after its
                                components are integrated. For example, a bicycle has the functional property of being a
                                transportation device once it has been assembled from its components.</li>
                            <li>non functional ESP - <br>which relate to the behavior of the system in its
                                operational environment. Reliability, performance, safety, and security are examples of emergent
                                properties. These are critical for computer-based systems, as failure to achieve a minimum
                                defined level in these properties usually makes the system unusable. Some users may not need
                                some of the system functions, so the system may be acceptable without them. However, a system that is unreliable or too slow is likely to be rejected by all its users. <br><br>

                                System reliability is a good example of an emergent property. Because of component interdependencies, faults can be propagated through the system. System failures often occur because
                                of unforeseen inter-relationships between components. It is practically impossible to anticipate
                                all possible component relationships. Software reliability measures may give a false picture of
                                the overall system reliability. <br><br>

            <li><h3>Explain the legacy system with the help of diagram.</h3>
            <p>
                Legacy systems are sociotechnical computer-based systems that have been developed in the past,
                often using older or obsolete technology. These systems include not only hardware and software
                but also legacy processes and procedures—old ways of doing things that are difficult to change
                because they rely on legacy software. Changes to one part of the system inevitably involve
                changes to other components. <br>
                Legacy systems are often business-critical systems. They are maintained because it is too risky
                to replace them. <br><br>
                <img src="../../graphics/legacy system component.jpg" alt="legacy system component" width="350px"><br><br>
                <b>Legacy system components</b><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b> System Hardware</b> – In many cases legacy systems have been written for mainframe hardware
                        that is no longer available that is expensive to maintain and that may not be compatible with
                        current organizational IT purchasing policies.
                        </li>
                    <li><b>Support Software</b> - The legacy system may rely on range of support software from the
                        operating system and utilities provided by the hardware manufacturer through to the compilers
                        used for system development.</li>
                    <li><b>Application software </b> - The application system that provides the business services is usually
                        composed of a number of separate programs that have been developed at different times.</li>
                    <li><b>Application data</b> - These are the data that are processed by the application system. In many
                        legacy systems, an immense volume of data has accumulated over the lifetime of the system.
                        This data may be inconsistent and may be duplicated in several files.</li>
                    <li><b>Business processes</b> - These are processes that are used in the business to achieve some
                        business objective. An example of a business process in an insurance company would be issuing
                        an insurance policy; in a manufacturing company a business process would be accepting all order
                        for products and setting up the associated manufacturing process.</li>
                    <li><b> Business policies and rules</b> - These are definitions of how the business should be carried out
                        and constraints on the business. Use of the legacy application system may be embedded in these
                        policies and rules.</li>

            <li><h3>Explain safety critical system with the help of diagram</h3>
            <p>Safety-critical systems are those systems whose failure could result in loss of life, significant
                property damage or damage to the environment. There are many well-known examples in
                application areas such as medical devices, aircraft flight control, weapons and nuclear systems. <br>
                <br><b>Example of simple safety critical system (An insulin pump control system)</b><br><br>
                Diabetes is a relatively common condition where the human pancreas is unable to produce
                sufficient quantities of a hormone called insulin. Insulin metabolizes glucose (sugar) in the
                blood. The conventional treatment of diabetes involves regular injections of genetically
                engineered insulin. Diabetics measure their blood sugar levels using an external meter and then
                calculate the dose of insulin that they should inject. <br>
                The problem with this treatment is that the level of insulin required does not just
                depend on the blood glucose level but also on the time of the last insulin injection. This can
                lead to very low levels of blood glucose (if there is too much insulin) or very high levels of
                blood sugar (if there is too little insulin). That causes the serious problem to the human body.
                <br>
                Current advances in developing miniaturized sensors have meant that it is now
                possible to develop automated insulin delivery systems. These systems monitor blood sugar
                levels and deliver an appropriate dose of insulin when required. A software-controlled insulin
                delivery system might work by using a micro-sensor embedded in the patient to measure some
                blood parameter that is proportional to the sugar level. This is then sent to the pump controller.
                This controller computes the sugar level and the amount of insulin that is needed. It then sends
                signals to a miniaturized pump to deliver the insulin via a permanently attached needle. <br><br>
                <img src="../../graphics/insulinpump.jpg" alt="insulin pump data flow" width="350px"><br><br>
                Figure shown above is a UML activity model that illustrates how the software transforms an
                input blood sugar level to a sequence of commands that drive the insulin pump. <br>
                Clearly, this is a safety-critical system. If the pump fails to operate or does not operate correctly,
                then the user’s health may be damaged or they may fall into a coma because their blood sugar
                levels are too high or too low. There are therefore two essentials high-level requirements that this
                system must meet: <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>The system shall be available to deliver insulin when required. </li>
                    <li>The system shall perform reliably and deliver the correct amount of insulin to counteract the
                        current level of blood sugar.</li>
                </ol><br>
                Failure of the system could in principle cause excessive doses of insulin to be delivered and this
                could threaten the life of the user. It is particularly important that overdoses of insulin should not
                occur.
            </p>
            </li><br><br><br>
            <li><h3>Explain about safety and security of system systems</h3>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li><u>Safety :</u><br><br>
                        Safety critical systems are systems where it is essential that system operation is always safe. That
                        is the system should never damage people or the system’s environment even if the system fails.
                        Examples of safety critical system are control and monitoring systems in aircraft, process control
                        systems in chemical and pharmaceutical plants and automobile control systems. <br>
                        It is increasingly important to consider software safety as more and more devices incorporate
                        software-based control systems. Safety requirements are exclusive requirements i.e., they
                        exclude undesirable situations rather than specify required system services. Safety critical
                        software are 2 types: <br>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Primary safety-critical systems</b> - Embedded software systems whose failure can cause hardware malfunction which results
                                inhuman injury or environmental damage.
                                </li>
                            <li><b>Secondary safety-critical systems</b> - Systems whose failure indirectly results in injury. Eg - Medical Database holding details of
                                drugs.</li>

                        Security is a system property that reflects the ability to protect itself from accidental or deliberate
                        external attack. Security is becoming increasingly important as systems are networked so that
                        external access to the system through the Internet is possible. Security is an essential prerequisite for availability, reliability and safety <br>
                        <br>Example: Viruses, unauthorised use of service/data modification. <br>

                            <li><b>Denial of service</b> - The system is forced into a state where normal services become unavailable.</li>
                            <li><b>Corruption of programs or data</b> - The system components of the system may alter in an unauthorised way, which affect system

                            <li><b>Vulnerability avoidance</b> - – The system is designed so that vulnerabilities do not occur. For example, if there is no external
                                network connection then external attack is impossible
                                </li>
                            <li><b>Attack detection and elimination</b> - The system is designed so that attacks on vulnerabilities are detected and remove them before
                                they result in an exposure. For example, virus checkers find and remove viruses before they

                            <li><b>Exposure limitation</b> - The consequences of a successful attack are minimised. For example, a backup policy allows
