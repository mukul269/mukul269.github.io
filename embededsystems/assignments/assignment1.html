            <li><h3>What is an embedded system?</h3>
                An embedded system is an electronic/electro-mechanical system designed to perform a specific <br>
                function and is a combination of both hardware and firmware (software).<br>
                <br> Every embedded system is unique, and the hardware as well as the firmware is highly specialised to<br>
                the application domain. Embedded systems are becoming an inevitable part of any product or<br>
                equipment in all fields including household appliances, telecommunications, medical equipment,<br>
                industrial control, consumer products, etc.<br></li><br><br>

            <li><h3>Explain the various purposes of embedded systems.</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Data Collection/Storage/Representation
                    <ul>
                        <li>Embedded systems designed for the purpose of data collection performs acquisition of data from the
                            external world. </li>
                        <li>Data collection is usually done for storage, analysis, manipulation and transmission. The term “data”
                            refers all kinds of information, viz. text, voice, image, video, electrical signals and any other
                            measurable quantities. Data can be either analog (continuous) or digital (discrete).</li>
                        <li>Embedded systems with analog data capturing techniques collect data directly in the form of analog
                            signals whereas embedded systems with digital data collection mechanism converts the analog signal
                            to corresponding digital signal using analog to digital (A/D) converters and then collects the binary
                            equivalent of the analog data. If the data is digital, it can be directly captured without any additional
                            interface by digital embedded systems.
                            </li>
                        <li>The collected data may be stored directly in the system or maybe transmitted to some other systems
                            or it may be processed by the system or it may be deleted instantly after giving a meaningful
                            representation. These actions are purely dependent on the purpose for which the embedded system is
                            designed. </li>
                        <li>Embedded systems designed for pure measurement applications without storage, used in control and
                            instrumentation domain, collects data and gives a meaningful representation of the collected data by
                            means of graphical representation or quantity value and deletes the collected data when new data
                            arrives at the data collection terminal. Analog and digital CROs without storage memory are typical
                            examples of this. Any measuring equipment used in the medical domain for monitoring without
                            storage functionality also comes under this category.</li>
                        <li>Some embedded systems store the collected data for processing and analysis. Such systems
                            incorporate a built-in/plug-in storage memory for storing the captured data. Some of them give the
                            user a meaningful representation of the collected data by visual (graphical/quantitative) or audible
                            means using display units [Liquid Crystal Display (LCD), Light Emitting Diode (LED), etc.]
                            buzzers, alarms, etc. Examples are: measuring instruments with storage memory and monitoring
                            instruments with storage memory used in medical applications. Certain embedded systems store the
                            data and will not give a representation of the same to the user, whereas the data is used for internal
                            processing.
                            </li>
                        <li>A digital camera is a typical example of an embedded system with data collection/storage/
                            representation of data. Images are captured and the captured image may be stored within the memory
                            of the camera. The captured image can also be presented to the user through a graphic LCD unit.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li>Data communication 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Embedded data communication systems are deployed in applications ranging from complex
                            satellite communication systems to simple home networking systems. </li>
                        <li>The data collected by an embedded terminal may require transferring of the same to some other
                            system located remotely. The transmission is achieved either by a wire-line medium or by a
                            wireless medium. </li>
                        <li>Wire-line medium was the most common choice in all olden days embedded systems. </li>
                        <li>As technology is changing, wireless medium is becoming the de-facto standard for data
                            communication in embedded systems. A wireless medium offers cheaper connectivity solutions
                            and make the communication link free from the hassle of wire bundles. </li>
                        <li>Data can either be transmitted by analog means or by digital means. Modem industry trends are
                            settling towards digital communication.
                            </li>
                        <li>The data collecting embedded terminal itself can incorporate data communication units like
                            wireless modules (Bluetooth, ZigBee, Wi-Fi, EDGE, GPRS, etc.) or wire-line modules (RS232C, USB, TCP/IP, PS2, etc.). </li>
                        <li>Certain embedded systems act as a dedicated transmission unit between the sending and
                            receiving terminal's, offering sophisticated functionalities like data packetizing, encrypting and
                            decrypting. Network hubs, routers, switches, etc. are typical examples of dedicated data
                            transmission embedded systems. They act as mediators in data communication and provide
                            various features like data security, monitoring etc</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li>Data (signal) processing
                    <ul>
                        <li>The data (voice, image, video, electrical signals and other measurable quantities) collected by
                            embedded systems may be used for various kinds of data processing.</li>
                        <li>Embedded systems with signal processing functionalities are employed in applications
                            demanding signal processing like speech coding, synthesis, audio video codec, transmission
                            applications, etc.</li>
                        <li>A digital hearing aid is a typical example of an embedded system employing data processing.
                            Digital hearing aid improves the hearing capacity of hearing impaired persons.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li>Monitoring
                    <ul>
                        <li>Embedded systems falling under this category are specifically designed for monitoring purpose. </li>
                        <li>Almost all embedded products coming under the medical domain are with monitoring functions
                            only. </li>
                        <li>They are used for determining the state of some variables using input sensors. They cannot
                            impose control over variables. </li>
                        <li>A very good example is the Electro Cardiogram (ECG) machine for monitoring the heartbeat of a
                            patient. The machine is intended to do the monitoring of the heartbeat. It cannot impose control
                            over the heartbeat. The sensors used in ECG are the different electrodes connected to the
                            patient’s body.</li>
                        <li>Some other examples of embedded systems with monitoring function are measuring instruments
                            like digital CRO, digital multimeters, logic analyzers, etc. used in Control & Instrumentation
                            applications. They are used for knowing (monitoring) the status of some variables like current,
                            voltage, etc. They cannot control the variables in turn.
                            </li>
                    </ul>
                </li><br>
                <li>Control
                    <ul>
                        <li>Embedded systems with control functionalities impose control over some variables according to
                            the changes in input variables. </li>
                        <li>A system with control functionality contains both sensors and actuators.</li>
                        <li>Sensors are connected to the input port for capturing he changes in environmental variable or
                            measuring variable.</li>
                        <li>The actuators connected to the output port are controlled according to the changes in input
                            variable to put an impact on the controlling variable to bring the controlled variable to the
                            specified range.</li>
                        <li>Air conditioner system used in our home to control the room temperature to a specified limit is a
                            typical example for embedded system for control purpose. An airconditioner contains a room
                            temperature sensing element (sensor) which may be a thermistor and a handheld unit for setting
                            up (feeding) the desired temperature. The handheld unit may be connected to the central
                            embedded unit residing inside the airconditioner through a wireless link or through a wired link.
                            The air compressor unit acts as the actuator. The compressor is controlled according to the
                            current room temperature and the desired temperature set by the end user. Here the input variable
                            is the current room temperature and the controlled variable is also the room temperature. The
                            controlling variable is cool air flow by the compressor unit. If the controlled variable and input
                            variable are not at the same value, the controlling variable tries to equalise them through taking
                            actions on the cool air flow.

                <li>Application specific user interface.
                    <ul>
                        <li>These are embedded systems with application-specific user interfaces like buttons, switches,
                            keypad, lights, bells, display units, etc. </li>
                        <li>Mobile phone is an example for this. In mobile phone the user interface is provided through the
                            keypad, graphic LCD module, system speaker, vibration alert, etc.</li>

            <li><h3>Explain the different Classifications of embedded systems.</h3>
                It is possible to have a multitude of classifications for embedded systems, based on different criteria. Some
                of the criteria used in the classification of embedded systems are:
            <ol>
                <li>Based on generation</li>
                <li>Complexity and performance requirements</li>
                <li>Based on deterministic behaviour</li>
                <li>Based on triggering</li>
            </ol><br>
            The classification based on deterministic system behaviour is applicable for ‘Real Time’ systems. The
            application/task execution behaviour for an embedded system can be either deterministic or nondeterministic. Based on the execution behaviour, Real Time embedded systems are classified into Hard and
            Soft. Embedded Systems which are ‘Reactive’ in nature (Like process control systems in industrial control
            applications) can be classified based on the trigger. Reactive systems can be either event triggered or time
            triggered. <br><br>
            <ol>
                <li><u>Classification Based on Generation</u>
                <br>This classification is based on the order in which the embedded processing systems evolved from the
                first version to where they are today. As per this criterion, embedded systems can be classified into: <br>
            <ol>
                <li><b>First Generation</b> The early embedded systems were built around 8bit microprocessors like
                    8085 and Z80, and 4 bit microcontrollers. Simple in hardware circuits with firmware
                    developed in Assembly code. Digital telephone keypads, stepper motor control units etc. are
                    examples of this.</li>
                <li><b>Second Generation</b> These are embedded systems built around 16bit microprocessors and 8
                    or 16 bit microcontrollers, following the first generation embedded systems. The instruction
                    set for the second generation processors/controllers were much more complex and powerful
                    than the first generation processors/controllers. Some of the second generation embedded
                    systems contained embedded operating systems for their operation. Data Acquisition
                    Systems, SCADA systems, etc. are examples of second generation embedded systems.</li>
                <li><b>Third Generation</b> With advances in processor technology, embedded system developers
                    started making use of powerful 32bit processors and 16bit microcontrollers for their design.
                    A new concept of application and domain specific processors/controllers like Digital Signal
                    Processors (DSP) and Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) came into the picture.
                    The instruction set of processors became more complex and powerful and the concept of
                    instruction pipelining also evolved. The processor market was flooded with different types of
                    processors from different vendors. Processors like Intel Pentium, Motorola 68K, etc. gained
                    attention in high performance embedded requirements. Dedicated embedded real time and
                    general purpose operating systems entered into the embedded market. Embedded systems
                    spread its ground to areas like robotics, media, industrial process control, networking, etc</li>
                <li><b>Fourth Generation</b> The advent of System on Chips (SoC), reconfigurable processors and
                    multicore processors are bringing high performance, tight integration and miniaturisation into
                    the embedded device market. The SoC technique implements a total system on a chip by
                    integrating different functionalities with a processor core on an integrated circuit. The fourth
                    generation embedded systems are making use of high performance real time embedded
                    operating systems for their functioning. Smart phone devices, mobile internet devices
                    (MIDs), etc. are examples of fourth generation embedded systems.

            </ol></li><br>
                <li><u>Classification Based on Complexity and Performance</u><br>
                    This classification is based on the complexity and system performance requirements. According to
                    this classification, embedded systems can be grouped into:
                    <br>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Small-Scale Embedded Systems</b> Embedded systems which are simple in application needs
                        and where the performance requirements are not time critical fall under this category. An
                        electronic toy is a typical example of a small-scale embedded system. Small-scale embedded
                        systems are usually built around low performance and low cost 8 or 16 bit
                        microprocessors/microcontrollers. A small-scale embedded system may or may not contain
                        an operating system for its functioning.</li>
                    <li><b>Medium-Scale Embedded Systems</b> Embedded systems which are slightly complex in
                        hardware and firmware (software) requirements fall under this category. Medium-scale
                        embedded systems are usually built around medium performance, low cost 16 or 32 bit
                        microprocessors/microcontrollers or digital signal processors. They usually contain an
                        embedded operating system (either general, purpose or real time operating system) for
                        functioning.</li>
                    <li><b>Large-Scale Embedded Systems/Complex Systems Embedded systems</b> which involve
                        highly complex hardware and firmware requirements fall under this category. They are
                        employed in mission critical applications demanding high performance. Such systems are
                        commonly built around high performance 32 or 64 bit RISC processors/controllers or
                        Reconfigurable System on Chip (RSoC) or multi-core processors and programmable logic
                        devices. They may contain multiple processors/controllers and co-units/hardware accelerators
                        for offloading the processing requirements from the main processor of the system.
                        Decoding/encoding of media, cryptographic function implementation, etc. are examples for
                        processing requirements which can be implemented using a co-processor/hard- ware
                        accelerator. Complex embedded systems usually contain a-high performance Real Time
                        Operating System (RTOS) for task scheduling, prioritization and management.</li>
