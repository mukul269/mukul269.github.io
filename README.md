# mukul269.github.io

this is a website created for the students of TRCAC BSc IT

# the folders containing pdf documents are :
	computergraphicsand animation
	computerorientedstatisticaltechniques
	corejava
	embeddedsystems
	softwareengineering

# cga.html, cj.html, se.html, es.html(not added), cost.html(not added) are pages that will need to be updated daily as the lectures commence.

current objectives and issues
- need to find a way to allow anybody who visits the website to be able to upload 	lecture notes
- better mobile responsiveness, even is it means to change the whole source code
- adding a comment box
- anything typed into the comment box should show up as plain text in another 	tab(sort of like a clipborad). this can help us type in any important piece of 	information that we need to remember.
- adding a splash screen
- instead of opening directly to the tables page, the index page needs to be changed to a simpler page with large buttons with all the subject names. clicking on the buttons should take the user to the respective subject document table.
